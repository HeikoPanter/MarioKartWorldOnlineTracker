# Introducing the Mario Kart World Online Tracker

The **Mario Kart World Online Tracker (MKWOT)** makes it easy for you to keep all your race results in one place. Be it worldwides, versus races, friend lobbies or knockout sessions, you can save every single race result with just a few presses.

Everything the app does happens locally on your phone and requires not internet connection or any access at all.

## Why?
The idea started back for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe where I created a huge Excel sheet for myself because I personally love the idea of knowing how much I play, how often the different tracks are picked and what tracks I perform the best and the worst on. So with the release of Mario Kart World I figured this is the perfect opportunity to finally make the idea a reality.

If you also like stats and data, you're at the right place!

## What can I do with MKWOT?
MKWOT can help you with the following:
- keep track of your online sessions
- save every single race or knockout result in the app
- view highlights of your results such as average position, amount of races, most played track etc.
- ability to export your entire result history to CSV format (e.g. for analyzing via MS Excel)

## How does it work?
If you want to save your results, the process is simple:
1. Start a new session via the side bar (either race or knockout)
2. Select the engine class (100cc, 150cc, Mirror)
3a. For race, select if you drove a three-lap track or a route
3b. For knockout, select the cup
4. Select the achieved position (1st to 24th)
5. Repeat from step 2 automatically

If you want to start a new session, either go back after a race result to the session screen or start a new session from the side bar

## How does it look like?
Here are a couple screenshots:

## How do I get it?

Keep in mind, currently the app is for **Android only**. No iOS support and since I do not have an iOS device myself I will probably not develop the app for anything other than Android.

You can download the release form this GitHub repository under [Releases](https://github.com/HeikoPanter/MarioKartWorldOnlineTracker/releases).

## Feedback or issues

If you have any feedback or issues please feel free to contact me here on GitHub by creating an issue and I will try to get back to you shortly.
